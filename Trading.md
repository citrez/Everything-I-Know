* Good till date/time
You must select a date and time when you want your order to be cancelled if it hasn't been filled.

* Fill or kill (FOK)
If the order can't be filled in full immediately, it will be cancelled.

* Execute and eliminate
As much of the order as possible will be filled at the price you specify. Any remaining part of the order will be cancelled.
