# Wikis I like

### Wikis

* [Nikita](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) - this is the wiki that started this wiki
* [Maggie appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Maybe the best example of a digital garden.
* [Tom Crichlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) - quite like the minimal design
* [zettelgarden](https://garden.rahulrajeev.net/first-principles) - cool idea, just using a graph to traverse the wiki
