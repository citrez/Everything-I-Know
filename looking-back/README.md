# Looking Back

# 2021

## Aug 2021

Been learning react for the cyber app with nathan. Props, Hooks, JSX, 

## December 2021

Have been working in pycharm. It has been useful to use and get to grips with testing. Also using the powerful debugging capabilities in pycharm. 

## Jan 2022

Have been looking to make progress on the auto trading alg with IG. Learning a lot in the job about more serious software projects. Just the fact that i feel a lot more comfortable with debugging is a step in the right direction. This is somewhat trivial, but im also keen to improve my touch typing, forcing myself to type properly when i remember, not taking my fingers off the keys. I,ve also become a lot more comfortable in pycharm, have also discovered the softare engeneering channel 'ArjanCodes' on youtube, which is making me feel a lot more legit.  
I want this month to be when i start to take touch typing really seriously, im serious about my efficiencies and touch typing seems like a really logical next step, it just takes a bit of self control not to revert back to the older (faster) ways.

Want to improve my AWS knowledge, this hasnt happened yet.
