  This is stuff I dont know where to put. I should periodically examine this to
  see how I can fit this into preexisting pages or make new pages to accomodate.

[The distraction economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYYuiWP0IpA&ab_channel=2veritasium). Low information diets. One of the reasion I started this wiki was to clear my mind when I feel like there is too much in it. A bit like [dumbledoors pensive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dumUElmlVJA&ab_channel=StefanDabija). The issue nowadays is now lack of information, but overload of it. Where does one even begin, and how does one start to organise it, how can we prioritise what we want to know. You could spend your entire life trying to keep up with the internet. Everyday more is uploaded than you'd have time to read/consume in your entire lifetime. 
It is very easy to become an information hoarder. This is not a good place to be. You do not want this wiki to become a place where information goes to die.
