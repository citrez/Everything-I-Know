# Open Banking

Open banking is a way of interacting with all (most) banks in a consistent way. This means that you can more easiliy get customer transaction data. It also makes payements easier, beause you can interact directly with the bank you way to send money from. 
When interacting with open banking data, a customer is redirected to thier bank account where they login and give access to thier data. 

There seems to be lots of vendors providing APIs which help access open banking data. Which is the best option?
