# D3

D3 uses SVGs to create interactive data visualisations. SVGs (scalable vector graphics) have an advantage over PNG and JPEG becaause they scale to stay crisp at any screen size.

The job of DÂ£ is, instead of manual writing out SVG elemts like \<line>\</line> \<rect>\</rect> etc etc, instead we can use D3 is javascript to get it to do it for us.
