# Javascript Tutorial

You can place javascript code in an html document. In the head of the docuemnt or in the body.

```
    <script>
        alert('Hello world')
    </script>
```

We can also externalise in a seperate js file.

### Data Types in JavaScript

Number - js doesnt discriminate betweeen floats and ints?

String

Boolean

Null - explicitly say the variable has no variable

Undefined - undefined is given to the var by the browser when they arent yet defined. Null is the explicit version of this.

Object - "everything in javascript is an object". Arrays, dates, Libteralls

Symbol
