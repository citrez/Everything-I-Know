# Javascript Tutorial

You can place javascript code in an html document. In the head of the docuemnt or in the body.

```
    <script>
        alert('Hello world')
    </script>
```

We can also externalise in a seperate js file. 

### Data Types in JavaScript

Number - js doesnt discriminate betweeen floats and ints?

String

Boolean

Null - explicitly say the variable has no variable

Undefined - undefined is given to the var by the browser when they arent yet defined. Null is the explicit version of this.

Object - "everything in javascript is an object". Arrays, dates, Libteralls

Symbol

## Node.js

### Links

* [explaination of what node is](https://nodejs.dev/learn). \
  Javascipt used to just run in a browser (exploreer, firefox, chrome etc), but then people thought it would be useful to allow backend code to be written by the language that developers already knew for the front end. Node.js allow JS to be run on the backend as well. 


## D3

D3 uses SVGs to create interactive data visualisations. SVGs (scalable vector graphics) have an advantage over PNG and JPEG becaause they scale to stay crisp at any screen size.

The job of D3 is, instead of manual writing out SVG elemts like \<line>\</line> \<rect>\</rect> etc etc, instead we can use D3 is javascript to get it to do it for us.
