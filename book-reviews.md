## Steve Jobs Autobiography - Walter Issacson

Steve jobs autobiography. This is a thought provoking biography about a difficult and passionate man that undoubtedly had a lasting impact on the world. It forces you to think about your own contributions and whether it is possible to decouple the nastiness from the inovation. 

Conplex personality. Often unkind, emotional, lack shame, rude to waitors, controlling and petty etc. The story that springs to mind is when he refused to let wozniac have the 'Number 1' employee tax badge. He was however convicted of the things he thought were important, like building great products. He could be very [charismatic and likeable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xchYT9wz5hk&ab_channel=CNBC).
