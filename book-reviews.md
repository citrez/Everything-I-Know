## Steve Jobs Autobiography - Walter Issacson

Steve jobs autobiography. This is a thought provoking biography about a difficult and passionate man that undoubtedly had a lasting impact on the world. It forces you to think about your own contributions and whether it is possible to decouple the nastiness from the inovation. 

Conplex personality. Often unkind, emotional, lack shame, rude to waitors, controlling and petty etc. The story that springs to mind is when he refused to let wozniac have the 'Number 1' employee tax badge. He was however convicted of the things he thought were important, like building great products. He could be very [charismatic and likeable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xchYT9wz5hk&ab_channel=CNBC).

## How to run like a kenyan
An enjoyable ride. The author takes you through his experience of moving to kenya, and romantisises about the simpler life of kenyan athletes. Makes you question what is important in this life, and if western ideas about success hold true. 

## A Beautiful Mind - Josh Nash Biography
What a trajedy and mystery mental health is. This guy wasnt a normal nice guy, but his life seems to have taken a very cruel turn. He seemed to to settle a lot in later life. 

## Animal Farm
A fun easy read. Well picked charachters and story that can make your blood boil with anger. Very poignant that it was written just a the and of WW2, aug 1945. 

## Harry Potter Series
The ultimate escapism. What has struck me on this rereading is how well paced the books are. During the year, just enough happens in Hogwarts to stop you from getting bored. They they ramp up nicely towards the end of each book. JK is a pro at certain things. Coming up with near similarities between wizarding world and real world. Creating relatable and believable charachters. Stories that are very well structured. The fact that she made harry muggle born means that she can keep on relating it back to him, which is actually us. Her ability to come up with names in exceptional, butter beer, Hogwarts, divination. The list could go on. Maybe im being bias, because HP has so fully seeped into popular culture, the these names seem to fit so well, but id argue the other way round, its these well suited names that have allowed the series to so easily seep. She plays so well will our schooling nostalgia, on old, grand imagery, castles, robes etc. Its a beautiful world. Comedy is also sown into the books, keeping them light. What a brilliant choice making dumbledoor a quirky powerful wizard, rather than a serious one for example.
