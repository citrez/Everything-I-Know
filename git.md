# Git

### Notes

Head, Tags, Branches and remotes all just point to a commit, which are directories of blobs \(the data stored in git\). Commits are just snapshots of your directory at a given point in time. 



### Commands

* `git gui` - for getting up a graphical interface

### Links

* [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
* [git internals PDF](https://github.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf) - look at git object types and git data model. Page 13 onwards
* [Interactive Visualisation of how git works](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/)
