# Exercise

## Running

maintain 35km/week, with a 12km long run. Push up to 40km when that starts to feel totally comfortable. Look to maintain during the winter with the aim of increasing speed sessions during the summer to push down pbs.

## Rowing 
Not the focus at the moment, in love with running again.

## Strength
Do a few home work outs with sarah, nothing serious, just good for conditioning.

## Flexibility
Yoga is a game changer
