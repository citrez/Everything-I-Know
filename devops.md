"DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality"

A github action is something that happens when something happens to a repo on github. There are many things that can happen to a repo. Someone might star the repo, create an issue, merge to main branch etc etc. These are all events. Events trigger workflows. Workflows can spin up one of more containers for you in the cloud. You then provide a set of instructions for the container to do something useful for you. Github will log all the steps and make it clear if something failed.
