# React

### Notes

In plain vanilla javascript you can access objects in an HTML document and manipulate then. You write HTML and put a &lt;script scr = index.js&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag at the bottom and then the JS can access and change the HTML.   
React tries to be a little cleverer and lets you write Javascript within the HTML, one of the advantages is it makes it much easier to read.  
  
React used the DOM \(Document Object Model\)
