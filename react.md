# React

### Notes

In plain vanilla javascript you can access objects in an HTML document and manipulate then. You write HTML and put a &lt;script scr = index.js&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag at the bottom and then the JS can access and change the HTML.   
React tries to be a little cleverer and lets you write Javascript within the HTML, one of the advantages is it makes it much easier to read.  
The whole core of what Javascript is about is responding to users input. We can do this a little bit with CSS, but JS allows us to do this very flexibly to a whole host of events.  


#### The DOM

React uses the DOM \(Document Object Model\), The DOM connected HTML pages, which disctate how a web pages are layed out, with JavaScript, a fully functional programming language.

The DOM stores a replresentation of an HTML document in a javascript object that we can work with and manipulate. At the end of the day all react is doing, is manipulating the DOM in a smart way.
