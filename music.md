### Artists and albums that never let me down
I need to think about the best place to keep information. Maybe this is best stored in spotify and putting this information here will lead to unnecessary repetition and make it diffiuclt to track. Having said that, i dont love the potify app experience.

* Dire Straights
* Simon and Garfunkle
