## Learning Python

* [PEP-8 Style guide for python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds)

* [Advanced Python](https://www.pythontutorial.net/advanced-python/)
    * [Closures](https://www.pythontutorial.net/advanced-python/python-closures/) - In python you can define a function within a functon (a nested function) and use a variable that is definied in the outer function. **By definition, a closure is a nested function that references one or more variables from its enclosing scope.**
    * [Decorators](https://www.pythontutorial.net/advanced-python/python-decorators/)

* [OOP](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-oop/)
Everything in python is an object. An object has a state and behaviors. To create an object you need to define the class it belongs to and from there you can create 1 or more objects. The objects are an instance of the class.

## pyenv
use pyenvs for using different python versions both globally and locally in directories/projects.

```pyenv versions``` shows you what you have.
