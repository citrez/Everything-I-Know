  This is a place where I put knowledge that I have gained. The idea is to make
  it as accesable as posible, so that I and other can use this as a resource.

## Introduction

This is my personal wiki where I share 'everything I know' about the digital world as [digital garden](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) in the form of an online [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) hosted on GitHub. I will be updating this wiki quite often as I use it myself daily both to keep an account of things I know as well as things I want to know and everything in-between.

### How to read this document

There are sections on the side. Each time iIlearn about a new topic or want to learn about a new topic, I'll make a section on it and fill it out as i go along.   
This was heavily inspired by [this digital garden](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps).
