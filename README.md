  This is a place where I put knowledge that I have gained. The idea is to make
  it as accesable as posible, so that I and other can use this as a resource.

# Introduction

This is my personal wiki where I share 'everything I know' about the digital world as [digital garden](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) in the form of an online [GitBook](https://app.gitbook.com/@ezracitron/s/everything-i-know/~/drafts/-MhJTm4D84VVaQ1-sBf-/gitbook) hosted on GitHub. 

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look here as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals.

I will be updating this wiki quite often as I use it myself daily both to keep an account of things I know as well as things I want to know and everything in-between.
