### Notes

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - this is a tag that tells the browser its html

&lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; this is the root tag of the document

&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; this is meta data about the page but does not get redered

&lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; this actually gets rendered 

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; a paragraph tag

&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; makes something bold

&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; italic

&lt;small&gt; &lt;/small&gt; make this word a bit smaller

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;h1&gt; - headings, they go from h1 to h6

&lt;ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; unordered list. This is a wrapper for &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; tags

&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; list items

&lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; orderied list. wrapper for &lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; division tag. Used to group documents into sections. Makes it eaasier to refer to them later. 

some elements do not have an opening and closing tag with content between them

&lt;br&gt; break tag

&lt;hr&gt; horizontal rule

there used to be &lt;hr /&gt; making this a 'self closing' tag. But this is no longer necessary in html5.

&lt;img&gt; - some tags .also need \*\*attributes\*\*. In img tags the attribute src is needed to tell the image tag where to look. The path is relative to where the document in \(the index.html\) i.e if it is in a folder called img then scr = 'img/image.png'. alt attribute is a description of it for accesabilty.

&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt; anchor tag. These have href attributes. anchor tags redirect you to other pages. The href tells you where to go. You can link to other html pages in your directory.

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; these link quotes from other sources. It has a cite attribute which tells you where the quote comes from. 

you can use the style attribute in paragraphs for example. 

&lt;!- - This is how you comment things in HTML you can use cmd + / shortcut  - -&gt;

 





**Dont forget** all HTML elemets can be thought of as boxs. This is known and the [box model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp).
