# CSS

### Notes

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - this is a tag that tells the browser its html

&lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; this is the root tag of the document

&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; this is meta data about the page but does not get redered

&lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; this actually gets rendered 

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; a paragraph tag

&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; makes something bold

&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; italic

&lt;small&gt; &lt;/small&gt; make this word a bit smaller



**Dont forget** all HTML elemets can be thought of as boxs. This is known and the [box model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp).
