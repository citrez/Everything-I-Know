  GitBook is a modern documentation platform that allows me to document
  everything from products to internal knowledge-bases and APIs. I'm using it as
  a place to document my thoughts and progress.

# Gitbook

Markup syntax can be used throughout gitbook. This is a good idea, because it is consistent across hugo, jupyternote books etc. 

```python
#python code can be written using
# ```py
for i in [1,2,3]:
   print(i)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also write hints
{% endhint %}
