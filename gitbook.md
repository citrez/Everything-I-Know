  GitBook is a modern documentation platform that allows me to document
  everything from products to internal knowledge-bases and APIs. I'm using it as
  a place to document my thoughts and progress.

# Gitbook

Markup syntax can be used throughout gitbook. This is a good idea, because it is consistent across hugo, jupyternote books etc.

```python
#python code can be written using
# ```py
for i in [1,2,3]:
   print(i)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also write hints
{% endhint %}

## Github integration
You can download all gitbooks files (which are mainly just markdown files) to your github. 
This allows you to write to gitbooks in VScode (or another text editor) and then push to git and it all sycs to your gitbooks
{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: The structure of your gitbook, i.e all the stuff in the left margin, is maintained in the summary.md file. This is something that caused me great frustration and took a while to work out. 
It is often easier to update and maintain the summary.md using the gitbooks GUI instead.
{% endhint %}

## Latex in markdown
Add latex using inline use a \$. Add a whole section using \$\$
  
$e^\aleph=\sqrt{t^\theta}$
