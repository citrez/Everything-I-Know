see my github repo on it

## SQL

See [drawsql](https://drawsql.app/) for visualising a database. 
Basically just a database schema, which allows you to map the relationship between entities to try to get it into normalised form. 

## DBML
[database markup language (DBML)](https://www.dbml.org/home/) - A cool idea, a way of writing documentation for databases. A bit like DDL (sqls data definition language, which is actually used to create, delete etc tables), but easier to read. It can be used to create visualisations of your database [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home).
