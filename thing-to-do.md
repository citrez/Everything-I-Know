Instead of trying to predict a particular stock, look for stocks that are _intrisically_ predictable. I.e train on 1 year, test on 1 month. Do this 3 time for each stock, see which has patterns.

If ever you can't think of something useful, take a look at wikis-i-like, resources or youtube-watch later.

Data is hard. Data can be complicated. Lets not make it harder than it needs to be. Data documentation / organisation unleashes the power of data in your ogranisation, so that anaylsts/ data scientists can actually do thier jobs.
