## Apps

* [fliqlo screen saver](https://fliqlo.com/)
* [scroll reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/) - helps the problem that I like the scroll direction to be different of mouse and trackpad
* keyboard maestro - automate anything on the mac
* [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) maybe use this to replace divvy as its free and open source. 
* Tinkertool - extra command line settings in a GUI
* alfred. [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFAzSsrXu_0)
* quickshade - for dimming the screen more

## Settings
For setting nighttime warmth. Settings -> display -> night shift

In automator I create a quick action, then I make a shortcut for that in settings -> keyboard -> shortcuts -> services.
