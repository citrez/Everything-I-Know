# Mac

## Apps

* [fliqlo screen saver](https://fliqlo.com/)
* [scroll reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/) - helps the problem that I like the scroll direction to be different of mouse and trackpad
* keyboard maestro - automate anything on the mac

* [divvy]()
* [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) maybe use this to replace divvy as its free and open source.
