# Text Editors / IDEs

## VScode
VScode has been an absoloute reveleation to me. Not only does it make you feel like a 'real programmer' but it just works how you'd want it to. The efficiencies you gain are real.

[VScode user guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics) - this looks like a very good guide to the main features.

[python in vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing) has incredible tricks and tips. 

* shift + enter
run one line in the termianl

## RStudio

## Datagrip
[datagrip wedsite](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) - click on 'take a tour' for a 45 min intro video.
cmd + j - live templates (snippets of code)
cmd + enter - run code
alt + enter

## Pycharm
This seems to be a very powerful IDE for developing in python. It is likely to become my default at work.

ctr+shft+r - run script
crt+space to auto complete itelisense stuff
opt+enter to add intentions
cmd+shift+a - to find an action within pycharm
alt + up/down to select the word phrase where the caret is. do it multiple times. 

opt+shft+up/down - move lines
cmd+shft+up/down - move whole methods

cmd+ -/= - to minimise/ maximise code
cmd+ shift +  -/= - to minimise/ maximise all code

ctr+shift+up.down to go to next /previous method

ctr+g - to select the sybol, keep pressing to get more. undo the last using ctr+shift+g

the difference between tab completion and enter completion is that tab replaces, enter enters it. Useful to remember. 
postfix completion. add a .if add the end of your expression, itl do the rest. 

use local history, if you want to bring back pieces of code, without undoing code you did after that.
