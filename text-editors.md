# Text Editors / IDEs

## VScode
VScode has been an absoloute reveleation to me. Not only does it make you feel like a 'real programmer' but it just works how you'd want it to, and the efficiencies you gain are real. 

### Shortcuts
(I use these on my mac)
* cmd + p - finding files/ folders in your working dir
* cmd + f - Find in the file you have open
* cmd + alt + f - Replace in the file you have open
* cmd + shift + f - Find in **all** files in WD. 
* alt + click - For multi-cursor functionality. 
* alt + cmd + s - Save all files.
