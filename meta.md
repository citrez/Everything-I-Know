Below you will find all notes I make. You can think of this as an online OneNote. It is increasingly necessary to have an organised and efficient way of accessing knowledge that you have learned. I have a blog as well, that I was previously using to document learnings, but it was proving too time consuming to maintain. This is a rougher 'note pad', 'digital garden' etc. Where I can go to a page and be reminded of the things I once knew and quickly gain access to the resources that will help me out.
